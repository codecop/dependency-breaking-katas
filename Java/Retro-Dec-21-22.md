### Retro
#### 21/DEC/2022

##### What happened?
- people might be late because the cold or they try get to home
- maybe we can try a later time next time? like 6 - 7 pm?

##### liked
- pair/mobbing with others as we don't get to do that often at work
  - need to find a more effective to pair/mob.
- I get to see what other people thinking and differnt way of oslving problem and testing and coding

#### Learned
- learned a little more about java lambda.
- different type of refactoring (intrroduce variables, fields, etc...)
- make the dependency explicit and bring the dependency up the chain is repeating quite often.

#### Lacked
  lacking more people, we have small mob today.
